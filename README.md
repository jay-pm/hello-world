An **algorithm** is a step by step list of instructions that if followed exactly will solve the problem under consideration.

Algorithms are like recipes: they must be followed exactly, they must be clear and unambiguous, and they must end.

Python is an example of a high-level language; other high-level languages you might have heard of are C++, PHP, and Java.
there are also low-level languages, sometimes referred to as machine languages or assembly languages. Loosely speaking, computers can only execute programs written in low-level languages.

Thus, programs written in a high-level language have to be processed before they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level languages. However, the advantages to high-level languages are enormous.

First, it is much easier to program in a high-level language. Programs written in a high-level language take less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely to be correct. Second, high-level languages are portable, meaning that they can run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications. Low-level programs can run on only one kind of computer and have to be rewritten to run on another.

Due to these advantages, almost all programs are written in high-level languages. Low-level languages are used only for a few specialized applications.

Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages: interpreters and compilers. An interpreter reads a high-level program and executes it, meaning that it does what the program says. It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations.

A compiler reads the program and translates it completely before the program starts running. In this case, the high-level program is called the source code, and the translated program is called the object code or the executable. Once a program is compiled, you can execute it repeatedly without further translation.

Many modern languages use both processes. They are first compiled into a lower level language, called byte code, and then interpreted by a program called a virtual machine. Python uses both processes, but because of the way programmers interact with it, it is usually considered an interpreted language.

Source code:  the instructions in a program, written in a high-level language.
If the instructions are strored in a file, it is called the source code file.

What is the difference between a high-level programming language and a low-level programming language?
It is high-level if the program must be processed before it can run, and low-level if the computer can execute it without additional processing.
Python is a high level language but must be interpreted into machine code (binary) before it can be executed.
